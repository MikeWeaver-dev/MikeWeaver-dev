### My Story

I first fell in love with coding while at an internship for Price Waterhouse (PwC). I got a job in their finance department thinking I would be crunching numbers or doing important finance calculations.  Instead, my manager - a huge tech nerd - challenged me to automate some of the workflow for the accountants. I spent most of my days coding in VBA, making macros and add-ons to help them. I absolutely loved it!

Following PwC, I started my senior year at UNC, where I was already committed to a dual major in economics and business. I decided to stay the course. I went on to work at a real estate consulting firm doing data analytics. I mostly used Excel, but also branched into more complex data processing software (R, Tableau), and sometimes made interactive tools for clients. I joined the company’s Business Intelligence team and developed several process automation software for myself and my colleagues.

I quickly realized I prefer coding to traditional consulting or data work. I was hooked, sometimes forgetting to eat and staying late just to play with my code.

Despite 5 years at RCLCO and two promotions, I felt it was time to switch to full time software development. I knew it would be tricky, having no formal training and entering in the age of AI, but it just felt like the right life-choice. So here we are!

I made my software portfolio and all the related apps in an effort to expand my coding knowledge and become more marketable. I had a blast making it and I learned a ton!

If you're here reading this you may be a coder yourself.  Perhaps you're even a recruiter looking to hire me! I know my coding journey isn't the most traditional, but I thank you for getting this far in the README and taking an interest in my work. I love the challenge and creative process of coding and hope one day to become a professional software developer!!
