**Hi, My name is Mike Weaver and I'm trying to break into a career in software development. My story is outlined below!** 

I first fell in love with coding while at an internship for PWC. I got a job in their finance department thinking I would be crunching numbers or doing important finance stuff. But they had no need for that. My manager - a huge tech nerd - challenged me to automate some of the workflow for the accountants. I spent most of my days coding in VBA and making macros and add-ons to help them. I absolutely loved it!

Following PWC I started my senior year in college. I was already committed to a dual major in economics and business, so I kind of just stayed the course. I went on to work at a real estate consulting firm doing data analytics. I mostly worked with Excel, but did branch into more complex data processing software (R, Tableau), and sometimes made interactive tools for clients. I also joined the companies Business Intelligence team and worked on several process automation software for myself and my colleagues.

I quickly realized I prefer coding to traditional consulting or data work. I just fell in love with it. I sometimes forgot to eat and would stay late just to play with my code. Once or twice I even neglected my primary job to get more time with my process automation work.

Despite 5 years at RCLCO and two promotions, I felt it was time to switch to software development. I knew it would be tricky, having no formal training and entering in the age of AI, but it just felt like the right life-choice. So here we are!

I made my software portfolio and all the related apps in an effort to expand my coding knowledge and make myself more marketable for jobs. I had a blast making it and I learned a ton!

If you're here reading this you may be a coder yourself. Hell, maybe you're even a recruiter looking to hire me! I know my coding journey isn't the most traditional, but I thank you for getting this far in the README and taking an interest in my work. I love doing this stuff and I hope one day I can get paid to write code every day!
